# Devcon 2020 Developer Workshop dataset

Welcome to the Algolia Devcon 2023 repository for the "Algolia 101: A comprehensive and hands-on developer training from Data Ingestion to Front-End" Workshop.

## What is this repository?

This repository contains the dataset that will be used during the workshop. It is a subset of the [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) dataset, containing about 10K movies.

## How to use it?

The dataset is available in the `data` folder. It is a JSON file containing an array of objects, each object representing a movie.
You can import it directly using Algolia's Dashboard or API.

## Shared Application ID and API Keys

For the purpose of this workshop, we have created two Algolia applications that you can use to import the dataset and follow along the workshop. Those Applications will be deleted 1 week after the workshop.
